# vpn-proxy

HTTP proxies through VPNs.

This project was inspired by [ProxyDock](https://github.com/pry0cc/ProxyDock), which is a script that converts your OpenVPN files into proxies.

vpn-proxy is like ProxyDock, but on steroids. It creates a unique proxy server that
automatically switches ips between all your `ovpn` files.

This way, you can have a cheap Luminati-like proxy service (using VPN services like CyberGhost), useful for web-scraping, data analytics and more.
